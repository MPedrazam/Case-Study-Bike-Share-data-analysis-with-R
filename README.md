The data available to May 2022, are: 24 files, corresponding to 24 months of trips data, collected from June 1 2020 to April 6 2022; 15 files for the data of quarter trips information from 2015 to 2020, 3
additional files regarding the stations information.

According to the project goal, I decided to work with the data for the most recent 12 months: April 2021 to March 2022. 12 files was downloaded from the cloud, and locally stored.

All the tables belonging from April 2021 to March 2022, were consistent with the variables they contained: Trip ID, type of bike, started trip and end trip, started station and end station, started and end coordinates, type of member. Each row in the table represent information for one single ride, identified by the “Trip ID”
